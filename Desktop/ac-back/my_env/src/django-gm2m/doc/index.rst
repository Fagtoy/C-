django-gm2m
===========

|copyright| 2014-2020 Thomas Khyn

Django generic many-to-many field implementation.

This django application exposes a ``GM2MField`` that combines
the features of the standard Django ``ManyToManyField`` and
``GenericForeighKey`` and that can be used exactly the same way.

It has been tested with Django 2.2.* and 3.0.* and their matching Python versions (3.5 to 3.8).
